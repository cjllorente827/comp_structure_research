# Lived Experiences from the Education System

1) My brain overloading and tiring itself out by constantly thinking of the point value vs time & effort required of certain assignments. Instead of devoting limited brain power to solving the problem, I was struggling to determine if it was even worthwhile to do the assignment at all. This is compounded by the anxiety the actual assignment creates and the potential cathartic release when you just decide to say "fuck it".

2) "Is Dumbledore gay?" (IDG) questions from pre-class reading assignments. The Harry Potter books do not explicitly state that Dumbledore is gay. The only way to find the answer is to infer it from extremely vague clues given in the books or to just Google it. That is, it is possible to read all 7 HP books and come away from it not knowing whether Dumbledore is gay. Additionally, it is extremely easy to determine Dumbledore is gay from not reading anything but the result of a Google search, but then you learn nothing of the major themes or plot of Harry Potter. An IDG question is a question with a direct answer which is not explicitly stated in the text, requiring students to do the extra work of inferring new knowledge from new knowledge (which I think can be demonstrated to be difficult), or just going outside the text to find the direct information. This creates a **perverse incentive** to actually avoid reading the text.  

3) Another category of unhelpful post-reading assignment questions. 

* "What questions do you have?"
* "Were you confused by anything you read?"
* "Were you surprised by anything you read?"

"Do you have any questions?" is unhelpful as a post-reading/post-lecture gauge of audience participation. Imagine a text/lecture as a MCMC walker exploring a 2-dimensional space. Obviously, neither a MCMC walker or a text/lecturer is capable of probing the entirety of space to the same level of depth. Some areas will covered in depth, others skimmed over, even more areas will completely ignored. The space explored by the walker/text/lecturer creates a "positive space" where new information has been learned. Someone completely new to the field, like a student, will only retain some fraction of what has been explored. Anything outside the explored space will be completely unknown to them, a "negative space". "Do you have any questions?" forces the student to probe this negative space. Is it any wonder that students are anxious about asking questions? You are specifically asking them to consider what they do not know and reveal exactly how much they do not know to their colleagues. Would it not be more beneficial to allow the students to probe the positive space and think about what it is they do know? **Does this have anything to do with the tendency of professors to ask questions that require making inferences from new information?**

"Were you surprised by anything you read?" is a really odd question considering it was assigned as a report question for a proposal evaluation exercise. Since I had never evaluated a proposal before, and thus, had no idea what to expect, it was impossible for me to be surprised. 

4) Potential common trap for professors: Casually expecting students to make inferences based on new information. Here I think the issue is less "expecting students to make inferences" and more the casual/implicit/unstated nature of the expectation. If you are asking the student to infer something, it should be made explicit, and the information required to make that inference should be presented as clearly as possible. Especially since the student may be missing necessary information that the instructor assumes they have.
