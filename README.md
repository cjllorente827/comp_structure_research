## TODO:
1) Create stellar density plots
 
 2) Switch halo extraction script to mpi4py instead of pymp and see if there's a notable performance increase
 
 3) Document and add improvements to run_rockstar script
    - Make it significantly more user friendly, i.e. directory agnostic, takes in single output file as argument
